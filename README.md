## About the project

ComicSnap is an application for manga and comic book lovers, created to help users choose their next reads through our recommendation system and to allow them to take into account the comics they have already read, giving them the chance to assign a rating from 1 to 5 stars and a weight that can influence the recommendations.

## Built with

ComicSnap was built using several technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end development, Python for the back-end development, and the Flask microframework to implement the server; Comic Vine was also used as an API to draw from for comics.
